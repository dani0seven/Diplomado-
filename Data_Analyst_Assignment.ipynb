And we expect you to not get any external assistance.\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","You are working with a US retail customer on a pilot deployment.  They are using technology to track their merchandise throughout their supply chain.  The flow of their supply is:\n","\n","*   **DC 1:**  Orders are filled and palletized.\n","*   **Truck:** Pallets travel from the DC 1 to DC 2 via semi-truck.\n","*   **DC 2:**  Pallets are unloaded, and additional merchandise may be added.  They are then reloaded onto a new truck.\n","*   **Truck:** Pallets travel from DC 2 to the Store.\n","*   **Store:** Pallets are unloaded, cases are removed, and stocked, and the empty cases are left behind the building awaiting pickup. \n","\n","Your job is to dig into the data and find compelling insights to show the value fo the technology and help move the contract from a pilot into a full scaled deployment. \n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","Each section has defined questions along with point values to help you prioritize your time.  \n","\n","In addition to the defined questions, the
